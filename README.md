# Made for [NSJS Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/nsjs-2024-jam-2). This game was developed under 48 hours.
## Heavily inspired by Celeste. This was my first solo jam project. Hope you enjoy it.
### Fail Forward is a 2D platformer game where when you die, you leave a ghost that repeats all your movement in your previous life. You can use your ghost as a platform, therefore you can fail strategically in order to overcome obstacles that you couldn't otherwise.

## Controls:
- Use Arrow keys to walk, C to jump and X to dash.
- You can walljump and wallslide. Press C to jump while sliding on a wall.
- You can stand on top of your ghost. Your ghost copies your previous movement until the point where you die and stays there. This enables you to fail strategically to help your future self.
- Coins regen your dash ability.
