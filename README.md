# Made for [NSJS Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/nsjs-2024-jam-2).
# Heavily inspired by Celeste. This was my first solo jam project. Hope you enjoy it.

## Controls:
- Use Arrow keys to walk, C to jump and X to dash.
- You can walljump and wallslide. Press C to jump while sliding on a wall.
- You can stand on top of your ghost. Your ghost copies your previous movement and stays where you died. This enables you to fail strategically to help your future self.
- Coins regen your dash ability.
